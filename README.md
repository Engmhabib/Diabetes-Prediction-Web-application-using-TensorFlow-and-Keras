Diabetes Prediction Web App

Features
User-Friendly Interface: Easy-to-use inputs for entering health-related parameters such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and more.
Real-Time Predictions: Instantly receive a diabetes risk assessment upon input submission.
Data Visualization: Interactive visualizations of diabetes-related data for enhanced understanding.
Advanced Machine Learning: Leverages a TensorFlow neural network model for accurate predictions.
How It Works
Users input their health metrics, including gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c, and blood glucose levels. The app processes this information through a pre-trained neural network model to predict the probability of being diabetic, presenting the results in a clear, understandable format.
