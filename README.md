Diabetes Prediction Web App

The Diabetes Prediction Web App is the ultimate solution for predicting your risk of diabetes. It offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to easily input health-related parameters such as age, BMI, blood glucose levels, and more. Upon submission of the information, it instantly provides you with a real-time diabetes risk assessment, giving you the peace of mind you need. 

Our advanced machine learning technology utilizes a pre-trained TensorFlow neural network model and a range of health metrics including gender, age, hypertension status, heart disease status, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c, and blood glucose levels to predict the probability of being diabetic with unparalleled accuracy. 

The app also features interactive visualizations of diabetes-related data for enhanced understanding. It utilizes a range of technologies, including Streamlit for the frontend, TensorFlow and Keras for the machine learning model, and Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization. 

Using the Diabetes Prediction Web App is simple and straightforward. You just need to clone the repository and install the required dependencies by running "pip install -r requirements.txt". Then, run the app by executing "streamlit run app.py" and open the provided local URL in a web browser to interact with the app. Don't wait any longer to take control of your health!
